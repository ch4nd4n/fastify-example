## Summary

Example fastify hello world.

Original plan was a grand plan. A plan that would do fancy things with Fastify. Anyway, I figured I would not do that, at least not in the near future.

I am on ARM processor and needed x86 to run docker containers, so the Github action refer to the feature-dockerize branch.

For dockerized example is in https://github.com/ch4nd4n/fastify-example/tree/feature-dockerize
